# 👋 Welcome to the Strug Lab GitHub 

Welcome to the **Strug Lab’s GitHub organization**.

This space hosts open-source tools, methods, and resources developed and maintained by the Strug Lab. Our work focuses on reproducible research, robust statistical methodology, and practical software that supports large-scale genomic and biomedical analyses.

Below is an overview of the tools and resources available in this organization.

---

## 🧭 Visualization Tools

Software for exploring, visualizing, and interpreting complex biological and genomic data.

- [`PangyPlot` – Visualizing graph-based pangenome data](https://github.com/ScottMastro/pangyplot)

- [`GWAS SVatalog` – Fine-mapping GWAS loci with structural variants](https://github.com/strug-hub/gwas-svatalog)

- [`CFTbaRcodes` – Understanding CFTR haplotypes](https://github.com/strug-hub/CFTbaRcodes)
